To run application

This application uses the following URI to request results
* API URL: https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=${ARTIST_NAME}

This endpoint returns 50 results from the keyword search term.
Not all of these results correspond to albums and not all of the albums are complete.
Despite this, I still tried to display as many songs from each album as possible
